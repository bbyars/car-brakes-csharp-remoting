CS553 Remoting Program, How to run:

Directory location: /Release/

Make sure Server.exe, Client.exe, and Remoting.dll are all in the same directory.
Run Server.exe & run Client.exe.

Enter the Server's computer name or IP on the Client application. localhost if they are on the same machine.
If you change the TCP Port, make sure to match the server and client.

Enter data in the textboxes on the Client. Click the Send button. See the (readonly) textboxes 
 on the Server update to match (within bounds of the variable, 1-100 or 1-10 for brake).

When the brake variable is more than 0, watch the friction increase until it hits max,
 then the brake returns to 0. Execution is paused until braking completes.
